weird love of dotted rhythms....
fast notes are way too fast - almost like chords - gets carried away i guess
long gap between first and next notes
longer note after lots of fast notes - has a hard time slowing down for that note
has no respect for rhythm - needs more complex model?
notes don't always line up how they should, especially in fast parts - look into grouping idea

wow actually sounding musical in places
rolled chords are actually very tasteful and not mechanical. A+
